ROOT project directory : <PhysCondDB>

This project is based on maven (mvn) so you need 
to install maven to be able to compile it.
The project has been tested using java versions 7 and 8.

0) Pre-compilation instructions
You need to create a property file in your <PhysCondDB> directory
and link this file in all modules sub-directories
The file is named: conddb-filter-values.properties
It contains a password for Oracle ATLAS_COND_TOOLS READER account:
condreader=xxxxxx 
This password is used in Web modules.
If you set it to a fake password, all services related to ATLAS COOL data
retrieval will not be active.

Some fields in this file are very important in case of deployment under
jetty, tomcat7 or jboss; e.g.
tomcat.datasource=java/OraDev11 [or java/H2DB]
h2.file.name=/tmp/h2physconddb

The first will tell the system what is the name of the tomcat datasource, referenced
from the CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml; the selected datasource can be either an Oracle
DB or H2 database for example.
The second defines the name of the h2 file that is used instead for local DB storage
in jetty in case the h2 profile is selected.



1) Build
Execute the following commands from project ROOT directory.
To compile the code:
<PhysCondDB>/$ mvn clean compile 
To package the code:
<PhysCondDB>/$ mvn package 
To install the compiled jars into maven repository
<PhysCondDB>/$ mvn install 

The previous steps can also be included in the same line
<PhysCondDB>/$ mvn clean install 
During this phase tests are also executed (src/test/...)


MODULES:
CondDBCool => Web application that is used to retrieve data from ATLAS COOL DB (using PL/SQL package)
              Go to the CondDBCool/README.txt for more informations.
CondDBWeb => Web application that is used to access the PhysCondDB conditions DB core services
              Go to the CondDBWeb/README.txt for more informations.


2) Deployment
   We can deploy the application in several environments. Below we list
   instructions for tomcat and Jboss wildfly.
   
   Tomcat7:
   ========
   Go to the tomcat installation directory to start tomcat server. In general
   this is defined as CATALINA_HOME.
   Set the profiles that you want to use:
   <$CATALINA_HOME>/$ export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dspring.profiles.active=prod,h2,basic"
  
   These profiles refer to 
   - prod : the database connection in tomcat (spring definition)
   - h2 : the database connections parameters for h2 database
   - basic : the authentication profile to be used
  
   If you are not at cern, you may need socks proxy to allow connections to Oracle DB
   that we use for testing; in this case the options should be:
   <$CATALINA_HOME>/$ export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dspring.profiles.active=prod,h2,basic -DsocksProxyHost=localhost -DsocksProxyPort=3129"
   
   Start tomcat server:
   <$CATALINA_HOME>/$ ./bin/catalina.sh start
   
   Go to project ROOT directory and choose the web module to install:
   <PhysCondDB>/$ cd CondDBCool
   <PhysCondDB>/CondDBCool$ mvn tomcat7:redeploy
 or
   <PhysCondDB>/$ cd CondDBWeb
   <PhysCondDB>/CondDBWeb$ mvn tomcat7:redeploy
   
   
   This command suppose that tomcat is running under: http://localhost:8080
   
   Jetty
   ========
   Jetty is a small server embedded within the application. Single modules can be deployed in Jetty
   by using the following command:

   Go to project ROOT directory and choose the web module to install:
   <PhysCondDB>/$ cd CondDBCool
   <PhysCondDB>/CondDBCool$ mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev,h2,basic jetty:run
 or
   <PhysCondDB>/$ cd CondDBWeb
   <PhysCondDB>/CondDBWeb$ mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev,h2,basic jetty:run
   
   In this case, the modules cannot be started together, but only one at the time.
   
     
   
3) spring profiles available:
   This prototype has profiles to create appropriate datasources and JNDI naming
   for retrieving a connection depending on the server where the module has been deployed.
   We can then use an environment variable to set the appropriate profile:
   spring.profiles.active 
   
   The variable can be set at command line level or using JAVA_OPTS or CATALINA_OPTS variables.
